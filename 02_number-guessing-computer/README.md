# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple and interactive number guessing game written in Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and a given number `x`, and the user has to guess it. The game gives feedback whether the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- The program generates a **random number between 1 and x**.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- If the guess is too low or too high, a message is shown accordingly.
- The loop continues until the correct number is guessed.

## 🧠 Features

- Random number generation
- Real-time feedback for the user
- User-friendly CLI (Command Line Interface)
