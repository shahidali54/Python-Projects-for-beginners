# Dash Dashboard Project

This is a simple interactive dashboard built using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), a Python framework for building web applications with plotly charts.

## 📌 Project Description

This dashboard displays a combination of a bar chart and a line chart using hardcoded data. It uses Dash's `dcc.Graph` component to render the plots and `html` components to structure the layout.
